Have you ever tweeted something out only to find it has a typo? I have. And then frantically select the tweet with the mouse, `Ctrl+C`, hit the "Delete" link, then over to the "Compose new tweet" box, `Ctrl+V` (in hope that you did indeed copy it), and then send. Whew!

Uhm, yes, let's go ahead and have that "Edit" button next to our tweets, that would be great.
